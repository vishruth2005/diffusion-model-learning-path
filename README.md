# A Sequential Task-based Learning Path for Diffusion Models
Fork the repository and attempt the tasks.

Any contributions for the betterment of the quality of the repository are invited!

This repository provides a structured, bottom-up learning path for understanding and implementing diffusion models in Python. It includes a sequence of coding tasks that start from foundational concepts in probability, stochastic processes, and generative modeling, leading up to full-fledged diffusion model implementations.

Each task comes with clear objectives, dataset recommendations, and progressive difficulty, covering topics like Gaussian noise, Markov processes, VAEs, denoising autoencoders, forward and reverse diffusion, noise prediction, U-Net architectures, and advanced techniques like DDIM.

The tasks are divided into two types, namely, Prerequisite Tasks (Pre Tasks) and Core/Real Tasks.

You can consider the Pre Tasks to be optional, if you are confident enough.

***
## **Pre-Tasks: Foundations for Diffusion Models**
These tasks cover essential mathematical and deep learning concepts required for understanding diffusion models.

- **Pre-Task 1: Understanding Gaussian Distributions**
- **Pre-Task 2: Sampling from Probability Distributions**
- **Pre-Task 3: Markov Chains and Stochastic Processes**
- **Pre-Task 4: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- **Pre-Task 5: Denoising Autoencoder**

## **Core Tasks: Diffusion Model Implementation**
These tasks cover the step-by-step implementation of diffusion models, from forward noise addition to reverse denoising.

- **Core Task 1: Forward Diffusion Process**
- **Core Task 2: Reverse Diffusion Process**
- **Core Task 3: Noise Prediction with a Neural Network**
- **Core Task 4: Variational Lower Bound (VLB) and Loss Function**
- **Core Task 5: Training a Basic Diffusion Model**
- **Core Task 6: Efficient Sampling with DDIM**

## 🚨 Disclaimer: Not a Challenge, Just a Learning Path! 🚨  

This repository is **not** a challenge, competition, or race. It's just a structured learning path through coding tasks to help you understand diffusion models from the ground up. There aren't many resources here yet, but I plan to add diffusion papers and useful links over time.  
**Google is your best friend**, look for the resources as you like!

Go at your own pace, experiment, and most importantly, **have fun with it!**
